Release Notes
=============

**1.6.1** --- released on 2023-04-02

- WebVTT now correctly writes events in cue start order, patch by Anton Melser (https://github.com/AntonOfTheWoods)
- Improved type hints
- Minor documentation fixes and improvements
- Migrated CI from CircleCI to GitHub, added Codecov to CI (we're currently at 93% test coverage)

**1.6.0** --- released on 2022-11-28

- Basic support for ``[Graphics]`` in SubStation files (Issue #59)
