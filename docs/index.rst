pysubs2
=======

pysubs2 is a Python library for editing subtitle files. It’s based on *SubStation Alpha*,
the native format of `Aegisub <http://www.aegisub.org/>`_; it also supports  *SubRip (SRT)*,
*MicroDVD*, *MPL2*, *TMP* and *WebVTT* formats. There is a small CLI tool for batch conversion and retiming.

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install pysubs2
    $ pysubs2 --shift 0.3s *.srt
    $ pysubs2 --to srt *.ass

.. code-block:: python

    import pysubs2
    subs = pysubs2.load("my_subtitles.ass", encoding="utf-8")
    subs.shift(s=2.5)
    for line in subs:
        line.text = "{\\be1}" + line.text
    subs.save("my_subtitles_edited.ass")

The library works in Python 3.7 or newer, with no extra dependencies.
It’s available under the MIT license (see bottom of the page).
